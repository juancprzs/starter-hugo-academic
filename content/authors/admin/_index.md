I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at *[KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en)* (Saudi Arabia) and *[Uniandes](https://uniandes.edu.co)* (Colombia). I am supervised by Professors [Bernard Ghanem](https://www.bernardghanem.com) and [Pablo Arbeláez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k0nZO90AAAAJ&hl=es). In research, I am interested in the robustness of deep learning models, and how robustness paradigms can be harnessed for other purposes. I'm a member of [IVUL](http://ivul.kaust.edu.sa) (Image and Video Understanding Laboratory) at KAUST, and [BCV](https://biomedicalcomputervision.uniandes.edu.co) (Biomedical Computer Vision) at Uniandes. Previously, I completed a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering at Uniandes. My advisor during my master's was Professor Pablo Arbeláez.
