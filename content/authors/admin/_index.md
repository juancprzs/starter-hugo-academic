I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Vision at *KAUST* (Saudi Arabia) and *Uniandes* (Colombia). My research interests include robustness of deep learning models and how robustness-oriented paradigms can be harnessed for downstream applications. I'm a member of [IVUL](http://ivul.kaust.edu.sa) (Image and Video Understanding Laboratory) at KAUST, and [BCV](https://biomedicalcomputervision.uniandes.edu.co) (Biomedical Computer Vision) at Uniandes.
