abstract: Real-world Super-Resolution (SR) has been traditionally tackled by first
  learning a specific degradation model that resembles the noise and corruption artifacts
  in low-resolution imagery. Thus, current methods lack generalization and lose their
  accuracy when tested on unseen types of corruption. In contrast to the traditional
  proposal, we present Robust Super-Resolution (RSR), a method that leverages the
  generalization capability of adversarial attacks to tackle real-world SR. Our novel
  framework poses a paradigm shift in the development of real-world SR methods. Instead
  of learning a dataset-specific degradation, we employ adversarial attacks to create
  difficult examples that target the model's weaknesses. Afterward, we use these adversarial
  examples during training to improve our model's capacity to process noisy inputs.
  We perform extensive experimentation on synthetic and real-world images and empirically
  demonstrate that our RSR method generalizes well across datasets without re-training
  for specific noise priors. By using a single robust model, we outperform state-of-the-art
  specialized methods on real-world benchmarks.
