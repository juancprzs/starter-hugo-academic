abstract: We address the problem of segmenting an object given a natural language
  expression that describes it. Current techniques tackle this task by either (i)
  directly or recursively merging linguistic and visual information in the channel
  dimension and then performing convolutions; or by (ii) mapping the expression to
  a space in which it can be thought of as a filter, whose response is directly related
  to the presence of the object at a given spatial coordinate in the image, so that
  a convolution can be applied to look for the object. We propose a novel method that
  integrates these two insights in order to fully exploit the recursive nature of
  language. Additionally, during the upsampling process, we take advantage of the
  intermediate information generated when downsampling the image, so that detailed
  segmentations can be obtained. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art
  approaches in four standard datasets, in which it surpasses all previous methods
  in six of eight of the splits for this task.
