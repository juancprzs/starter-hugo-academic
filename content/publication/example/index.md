abstract: "This paper studies how encouraging semantically-aligned features
  during deep neural network training can increase network robustness. Recent
  works observed that Adversarial Training leads to robust models, whose learnt
  features appear to correlate with human perception. Inspired by this
  connection from robustness to semantics, we study the complementary
  connection: from semantics to robustness. To do so, we provide a robustness
  certificate for distance-based classification models (clustering-based
  classifiers). Moreover, we show that this certificate is tight, and we
  leverage it to propose ClusTR (Clustering Training for Robustness), a
  clustering-based and adversary-free training framework to learn robust models.
  Interestingly, ClusTR outperforms adversarially-trained networks by up to 4%
  under strong PGD attacks. Our code for reproducing our results can be found at
  https://github.com/rethinking-clustering-for-robustness."
