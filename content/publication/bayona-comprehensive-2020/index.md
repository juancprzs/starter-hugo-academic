abstract: "Background: Health care delivery for cerebrovascular diseases is a complex\
  \ process, which may be improved using telestroke networks. Objective: The purpose\
  \ of this work was to establish and implement a protocol for the management of patients\
  \ with acute stroke symptoms according to the available treatment alternatives at\
  \ the initial point of care and the transfer possibilities. Methods: The review\
  \ board of our institutions approved this work. The protocol was based on the latest\
  \ guidelines of the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association.\
  \ Stroke care requires human and technological resources, which may differ according\
  \ to the patient's point of entry into the health care system. Three health care\
  \ settings were identified to define the appropriate protocols: primary health care\
  \ setting, intermediate health care setting, and advanced health care setting. Results:\
  \ A user-friendly web-based telestroke solution was developed. The predictors, scales,\
  \ and scores implemented in this system allowed the assessment of the vascular insult\
  \ severity and neurological status of the patient. The total number of possible\
  \ pathways implemented was as follows: 10 in the primary health care setting, 39\
  \ in the intermediate health care setting, and 1162 in the advanced health care\
  \ setting. Conclusions: The developed comprehensive telestroke platform is the first\
  \ stage in optimizing health care delivery for patients with stroke symptoms, regardless\
  \ of the entry point into the emergency network, in both urban and rural regions.\
  \ This system supports health care personnel by providing adequate inpatient stroke\
  \ care and facilitating the prompt transfer of patients to a more appropriate health\
  \ care setting if necessary, especially for patients with acute ischemic stroke\
  \ within the therapeutic window who are candidates for reperfusion therapies, ultimately\
  \ contributing to mitigating the mortality and morbidity associated with stroke."
